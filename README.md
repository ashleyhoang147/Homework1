# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

This existing webpage has been refactored to become more accessible so that the site is optimized for search engines. The following changes have been made to the code:

- Consolidating CSS selectors and properties, 
- Organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- Including comments before each element or section of the page.


## The code is now subject to the follow standards

```
HTML Elements are semantic
Meaningless tags are replaced with proper tags
The elements follow a logical structure with logical layout 
Images include accessible alt attributes
Heading contributes follow sequential order
Title elements are meaningful and descriptive
```
